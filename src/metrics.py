    """
    For a binary segmentation task, calculate the Continuous Dice Coefficient
    (CDC) between a ground truth G (y_true) and a predicted segmentation S
    (y_pred).

    This function first flattens the input tensors, and then calculates the
    CDC based on the formula:
        CDC = 2 * |G âˆ© S| / (c * |G| + |S|),
    where G is the ground truth, S is the segmented image, and c is a
    correction factor that depends on the size of the intersection of G and S.

    Returns:
        A tensor containing the Continuous Dice Coefficient (CDC) with a value
        ranging from 0 to 1. A CDC value of 1 indicates a perfect overlap,
        meaning the segmentation is identical to the ground truth. Conversely,
